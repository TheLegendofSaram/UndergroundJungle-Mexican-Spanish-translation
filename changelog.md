# Release 20.1.1

Changes:

* Changed the texture of the Axe of Regrowth.
* The Axe of Regrowth now replants saplings on the same block that was broken instead of the one below.
* If [Woodworks](https://github.com/team-abnormals/woodworks) or [Quark](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Quark) are installed, the chests in the temple will be replaced with jungle chests.

# Release 20.1.1

Main changes:

* [Phantom Library](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/PhantomLoader) is no longer required. It was a fun experiment, but it only made things more likely to crash.

Additions:

* **Jungle spores** can now be collected from jungle vines.
* Added the **Axe of Regrowth**, an axe that can replant saplings when chopping down trees.
* Added the **Blade of the Jungle**, a sword that has a 10% chance to inflict poison on hit.
* Amethyst geodes in the underground jungle have been replaced with **"honey geodes"**.

Changes:

* Changed the texture of the temple key to match the upcoming trial key.

Fixes:

* Fixed crash when generating giant mushrooms underground.

# Release 20.1.0

Main changes:

* **Underground Jungle** now requires the [Phantom Library](https://github.com/PhantomLoader/PhantomLoader).
* The version number now follows the convention `<minecraftMajor>.<minecraftMinor>.<modVersion>`. That means version `20.1.0` is the first version for Minecraft `1.20.1`.

Additions:

* Added `ru_ru` language

Fixes:

* Fixed the biome generating on the surface when TerraBlender is installed (for real this time... I hope)
